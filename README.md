# react-interview

Welcome to the Runway frontend exercise! We really appreciate you taking time to show us your
frontend development skills.

This repository is configured with a bunch of widely-used tools that are part of our
frontend engineering stack at Runway: React, NextJS, TypeScript, and more. It also includes
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started), a flexible component library that contains
handy building blocks for creating React apps.

Along with the tooling, you'll find a few components to help get you up and running on the
exercise. Our goal with the repo is to save you time creating a modern development
environment and writing boilerplate code. You're welcome to use some,
all, or none of what's included here. If you prefer to start with something like
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and to
borrow selectively from this repo, please feel free to do so.

## Installation

You can install dependencies using `yarn install` and run the app using `yarn dev`.

## Deployment

You can see a deployment for the project at https://react-interview-one.vercel.app/

If Vercel is functioning properly, you should be able to see a preview deployment for a merge request when you open it.
